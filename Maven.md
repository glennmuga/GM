## Maven 

## What is Maven?
Maven is a popular open-source build tool developed by the Apache Group to build, publish, and deploy several projects. It is written in Java and is used to build projects written in C#, Scala, Ruby, etc.

This tool is used to develop and manage any Java-based project. It simplifies the day-to-day work of Java developers and aids them in their projects.

## What does Maven help with?
Maven helps with the following:

Apache Maven helps manage all the processes, such as building, documentation, releasing, and distribution in project management.

The tool simplifies the process of project building. It increases the performance of the project and the building process.

The task of downloading JAR files and other dependencies is done automatically.

Maven provides easy access to all the required information.

Maven makes it easy for the developer to build a project in different environments, without worrying about the dependencies, processes, etc.

In Maven, it is simple to add new dependencies, all you need to do is to write the dependency code in the pom file.

## What is POM?
Project Object Model (POM) refers to the XML files with all the information regarding project and configuration details.

It has the description of the project, information regarding the versioning and configuration management of the project.

The XML file is in the project home directory. When we tend to execute a task, Maven searches for the POM in the current directory.

## What all is included in the POM?
POM contains the following configurations:

Dependencies

## Maven install and maven clean difference 
The commands mvn install and mvn clean serve different purposes in the Maven build lifecycle:

mvn clean
Purpose: This command is used to remove all files generated by the previous build. It deletes the target directory, which contains compiled classes, JAR files, and other build artifacts.
When to Use: Use mvn clean when you want to ensure that your build starts from a clean slate, without any remnants from previous builds1.

mvn install
Purpose: This command compiles the code, runs tests, packages the code into a JAR or WAR file, and installs the package into the local Maven repository. This allows other projects on the same machine to use the built artifact as a dependency.
When to Use: Use mvn install when you want to build your project and make the resulting artifact available for other projects2.
Combined Command: mvn clean install
Purpose: This command combines both clean and install phases. It first cleans the project by removing the target directory and then proceeds to compile, test, package, and install the project.
When to Use: Use mvn clean install to ensure a fresh build and to install the artifact into the local repository in one go3.
